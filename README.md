# üõª Radio-Controlled Car for Surveillance and Data Retrieval

## üìå Project Overview

This IoT project is centered around an RC (Radio-Controlled) Car equipped with sensors and smart features, designed for:

- **Surveillance**: Monitoring hard-to-reach or sensitive areas using real-time video.
- **Data Retrieval**: Collecting environmental data such as temperature, humidity, or gas levels, or mapping terrain in exploration contexts.

The RC Car can be remotely operated over the Internet through a **dedicated WebApp**. The system includes a camera for live video feed, various onboard sensors, and the ability to process and respond to image data through server-side machine learning.

The WebApp (hosted on a Python server) enables users to:
- View the car‚Äôs perspective via a real-time video stream.
- Control the car's movement (steering, speed, direction).
- Manage sensors and peripherals (e.g., LEDs, distance sensors).
- Save image frames for further analysis.
- Run object recognition on saved images.
- Receive automated alerts through a Telegram bot when specific objects are detected.
