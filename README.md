# üõª Radio-Controlled Car for Surveillance and Data Retrieval

## üîç Project Overview

This IoT project involves the development of a Radio-Controlled (RC) Car equipped with sensors and electronic modules, designed for two main applications:

- **Surveillance**: Monitoring hard-to-reach or restricted areas using a live camera stream.
- **Environmental Data Collection**: Measuring parameters such as temperature, humidity, or gas levels, useful for exploration or field analysis.

The RC Car is remotely operated through a **WebApp** connected via **ESP32**, and features:

- Remote control of vehicle motion (steering, speed, direction)
- Real-time video streaming from an onboard camera
- Frame capture and saving functionality
- Image analysis via a server-side machine learning algorithm
- Automatic Telegram notifications when specific objects are detected

An **Arduino board** handles data acquisition from the sensors mounted on a breadboard, allowing for future expansion with additional modules.
